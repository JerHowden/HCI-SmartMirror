# HCI Smart Mirror Project
Project By: James Fallon, Haroon Saeed, Elias Moreno, and Jeremiah Howden

## Weather
OpenWeatherMap API was used with our current address denoted within the API request. The feature displays an icon depicting the current weather conditions of Lubbock, TX and a current tempature of the area.

## Agenda
A users personalized agenda is shown at a location of the users choosing with either completed or incompleted task. The location of this widgit is customizable in each user profile.

## Time/Date
Time and date may be displayed at a location of the users choosing. This utilizes the moment library to get this information.

## Facial Recognition
Mirror may have multiple users with their own individually customiazable interfaces. FaceAPI.js was implmented within this project and users were given personalized keys for recognition. This service is 
used as a login feature for each individal user profile and will provide the personalized user interface after recognition is detected.

## Commute Directions
User inputs current address and a destination address representing work or school. This current address and destination may vary between diffrent user profiles. Currently locations are hardcoded within the project and fetch the directions from MapBoxAPI.

## News Feed
User customizable news feed will display based upon the users prefrences. For instance if the user
prefers predominately sports news then they may use that as a preset to feed into their interface.
It utilizes NewsAPI.org to fetch the information and provides the users with the most up to date 
information availible.

## Refrences
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
